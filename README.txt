# NeuroTechR3 Companion App

NeuroTechR3 develops evidence-based exergame technologies that help clinicians optimize rehabilitation outcomes for individuals with neurological diseases.  
Patients utilize a special camera to capture their hand and wrist movements, allowing them to play motion-based games that function as neuro-rehabilitation therapy.  

During the fall of 2023, I worked in a team of 4 to develop a React-Native mobile companion app for NeuroTechR3. The companion app allows patients to keep track of their progress by charting  
exergame scores as well as detailed bio-data for their hand movements. My team and I developed this app from the ground up, starting with basic wireframes for user flow and finishing with a fully functional app  
synchronized with NeuroTechR3's S3 database.
